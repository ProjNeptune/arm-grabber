# neptune

Much like the exploration of Mars and the moon, Rovers are used to collect samples and analyze such samples to further explore the unknowns. Unlike Mars, over 80% of the oceans havenâ€™t been fully analyzed and scanned even in the present. The primary reason for the lack of explored regions is given with how current solutions are either too cumbersome or require too much time to function. With Project NEPTUNE, we hope to make self-sustaining deployables that can be sent as fleets equipped with different equipment that accelerate the exploration of the ocean.

## Prerequisites

NEPTUNE is an open-source project. The code necessary to drive the rover is available to be modified and used in your own projects.

However, this is a currently ongoing project, any use of the code can lead to potential damage of components.

Right now, you will need:
```
- Python 3.6+
- Raspberry Pi 4
- NEMA 17 Stepper Motor
- a4988 stepper motor driver
```
